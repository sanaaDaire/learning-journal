1. CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside
1. its own box and uses rules to indicate how that
1. element should look.
1. X Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the
1. elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that
1. indicate what these elements should look like).
1. X Different types of selectors allow you to target your
1. rules at different elements.
1. X Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties
1. of the element that you want to change, and the values
1. of those properties. For example, the font-family
1. property sets the choice of font, and the value arial
1. specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
1. X CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,
1. although they may appear within an HTML page
